Welcome to my Portfolio Repository

In this repository I am showing a basic site I've built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Additionally, I've also added the files related to apps I have built using Python. 

- HTML
An organized basic HTML document, using some of the most common elements and attributes found on a website. 

- CSS
This CSS document shows the most basic HTML formatting (fonts, colors, text-alignment) as well as a more dynamic features, like animations, @media, @keyframes, image slideshow and contact form formatting.

- JS
The functions within this JS document make the contact form open and close upon clicking and changes the images on the slideshow upon clicking on an arrow.

- Python
Two projects --a banking app that lets the user deposit and withdraw funds, as well as a list of transactions, and a hotel app that shows the items available for purchase in their restaurant meny.

I will continue to improve the design and usability of this website as I acquire more coding skills.
Thank you!
